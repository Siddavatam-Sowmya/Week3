Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application
Hello Everyone,

I’m excited to share my Tic-Tac-Toe web application, developed during my time at Prodigy Infotech. This project, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, includes all the classic features of Tic-Tac-Toe: tracking player moves, checking for winning conditions, and allowing for a game restart.

Working on this project allowed me to further enhance my JavaScript skills, particularly in managing game states and creating an interactive user experience. I’m looking forward to continuing my journey in web development with more exciting projects!
